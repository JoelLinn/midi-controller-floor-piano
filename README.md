# midi-controller-floor-piano
Converts your awful sounding floor piano into a midi keyboard controller you can hook up to your synthesizers.
It uses an ARM NXP LPC1113 MCU which is hopelessly overpowered but still quite cheap.

Fits where the stock board belonged and supports the original battery, buttons and leds.
The firmware, although working great, is merely in a POC state so I would prefer to hand it out only on request.
